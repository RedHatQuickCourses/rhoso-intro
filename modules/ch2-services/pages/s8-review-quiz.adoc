= Review Quiz: Red Hat OpenStack Services

:time_estimate: 5

Objective::

Assess the learnerâ€™s understanding of the purpose and utility of each Red Hat OpenStack service.

WARNING: Pending review.

// This review quiz takes the opportunity to relate and contrast services presented in different lecture sections. This may surprise students looking for an "easy" quiz.

== Questions

1. True or false: Usage of Cinder and Neutron is optional, though most real-world applications will require both.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

2. True or False: Glance is an alternative image service for OpenStack clusters which do not run Swift or any other form of object storage.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

3. True or False: Neutron provides network connectivity for server instances inside an OpenStack cluster. To provide network connectivity with external servers, including instances in other clusters, you require additional networking services such as Octavia and Designate.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

4. True or False: Octavia can only provide simple IP load balancers (layer 3). More sophisticated load balancer needs (layer 7) require a specialized application such as HAproxy or Squid.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

5. True or False: Though it is common exposing Swift objects to outside an OpenStack cluster, to clients on the Internet, it is *not* common to expose Manila file shares for the same clients.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

6. True or False: For most applications, object storage using the S3 API is a drop-in replacement for operating system file access systemcalls.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

7. True or False: Barbican provides a solution for the common issue of leaking access credentials hardcoded in source code stored in GitHub repositories.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

8. True or False: Heat orchestrates running multiple instances of the same application, running in multiple, independent OpenStack clusters, for geolocation and disaster recovery.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

9. True or False: Designate enables automated workflows where new applications are deployed and immediately get assigned human-readable URLs.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

10. True or False: Plamement and Ceilomer may seem to be related, because both track the usage of compute capacity by applications on OpenStack clusters, however, they are actually unrelated and provide different data: Placement is about static usage of resources, like how many virtual CPUs are available for creating more server instances, while Ceilometer is about dynamic usage of resources, like how much CPU is in use right now with multiple simultaneous end-users accessing applications.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

11. True or False: The Horizon dashboard provides long-term performance metrics and capacity planning estimation based on data from Ceilometer.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False

12. True or False: The Ironic service enables automated management of compute nodes in an OpenStack cluster.

* [ ] True
* [ ] False
