= Regions, AZs, and Cells.

Objective::

Describe how to structure a large OpenStack cluster to address performance and reliability requirements of applications and how operators configure workloads for the topology of a cluster.

WARNING: Work in Progress

== Logical and Physical Organization of OpenStack Clusters

In the previous section, we introduced how OpenStack enables users to organize their teams and applications using domains and projects. They provide logical groups that addresses the organizational structure of your teams and applications. At the end of the section, we introduced quotas, which links that logical structure with physical characteristics of your cluster, such as compute capacity.

OpenStack Operators need some understanding of the physcal topology of their OpenStack clusters to ensure their applications run matches their performance and reliability requirements. Sometimes applications need special classes of hardware, such as GPUS; sometimes it is about high-availability, ensuring applications stay operational and their end-users do not notice when a compute server fails.

To address those requirements, OpenStack offer many ways of grouping compute capacity. Most  of them focus on the compute nodes, and some focus on control plane services:

Regions::

A region is a mostly stand-alone OpenStack cluster which manages its own compute resources. Multiple clusters, in different regions, share a single pair of Keystone and Horizon services, giving them an unified view as a single private cloud.

Availability Zones (AZs)::

An availability zone is a large failure domain inside an OpenStack cluster. It can be defined by a server rack, an uninterruptive power supply, a network switch, a data center building, or any other physical constraint that creates the possibility of all compute resources in the AZ becoming unavailable at the same time.

Host Aggregates::

A host aggregate is a group of compute nodes which share common characteristics that make them more desirable to certain workloads compared to other groups of nodes. For example, because of the availability of fast local storage, GPUs, or network accelerators.

Compute Cells::

A compute cell is a partition internal to an OpenStack control plane. It deals with the scalability and availability of OpenStack services themselves instead of compute nodes. OpenStack services in the same cell share common back-end services, such as databases and message queues, which can be scaled and managed in cells independent of AZs.

OpenStack Operators usually have visibility of only regions and AZs but not of host aggregates and cells. They are impacted by host aggregates and cells indirectly, from the definition of server flavors and other API resources which impact the scheduling of serer instances on cluster nodes.
