=  OpenStack Operations and Administration Roles

*Objective:*

Describe the role and typical tasks performed by Red Hat OpenStack Operations personnel, and how they interact with other IT Operations roles.

== Kinds of OpenStack Users

The users of an OpenStack cluser are not end-users, they are IT professionals, usually with an operations-focused job role. It is true that application developers sometimes have access to OpenStack clusters and manage their own VMs, but them they are acting as OpenStack Operators.

For the purposes of the Red Hat OpenStack training courses, we distinguish between two kinds of OpenStack users:

OpenStack Operators::

They manage application workloads running on OpenStack clusters. They manage server instances (VMs), virtual networks, and other OpenStack API resources. This user role is the focus of this course and the remaininer of the OpenStack operations learning journey.

OpenStack Administrators::

They manage OpenStack clusters, including its control and data planes. They manage OpenStack services and compute nodes, using OpenStack API resources and also using Kubernetes API resources, OpenStack operator custom resources, and Ansible playbooks. This user role is the focus of a different set of courses, which comprises the OpenStack Administration learning journey.

If you are new to OpenStack it's recommended that you gain experience as an OpenStack Operator before taking responsibility of OpenStack Administrator tasks. An OpenStack Administrator can also perform, according to needs, the tasks of OpenStack Operators. In fact, OpenStack Admninistrators are typically expected to have all skills and experience of OpenStack Operators.

== OpenStack Users and other IT Job Roles

Depending on the size of an organization, OpenStack users can either perform other IT roles by themselves or work closely with IT professionals from other roles. For example, an OpenStack Operator may also be the System Administrator who manages the RHEL operating system inside a server instance.

As a counter-example, an OpenStack Operator may delegate the configuration of the operating system inside a server instance to a Database Administrator, who is responsible for the database server running inside that server instance. OpenStack Operators usually work closely with DevOps Engineers, Email Administrators, ERP Administrators, and other IT roles focused on application development or application management.

Similarly, an OpenStack Administrator may also be an OpenShift Administrator. And as a counter-example, an OpenStack Administrator may work closely with a RHEL Systems Administration team responsible for all servers in the organizaiton, including compute nodes of an OpenStack cluster. OpenStack Administrators usually work closely with Storage Administrators, Network Administrators, and other IT Operations roles focused on data center infrastructure and platforms.

== OpenStack Users in Large Organizations

On smaller organizations, the same team performs both OpenStack Operator and Administrator roles. On larger organizations, multiple teams of OpenStack Operators might be responsible for different workloads running on the same cluster. Conversely, a larger OpenStack Administration team migh split into subteams who manage different Az or cells of a single cluster.

The scope of work of an OpenStack Operator or Administrator usually includes multiple clusters. It's unlikely that an organization will run all their workloads and put all their physical servers in a single OpenStack cluster. More frequently, they'll have multiple clusters which run instances (or copies) of the same workloads, to be closer to their end users or for high availability purposes.
