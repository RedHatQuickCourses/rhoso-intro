== Questions

// This quiz could include a matching or drag-and-drop portion but we cannot do that on Antora. :-(

// Crap, Antora (or adoc?) breaks question numbering if there are comments between questions >:-(

// Q1: Even if a learner is not well versed in Linux system administration (which is a prerequisite for this course!) they should be able to get the clues from "inside a VM".

// Q2: Taking care to not include OpenStack jargon that might be unknown from learners, such as "provider networks".
// Learners should be able to figure out the right answers from scope of one workload vs an entire cluster.

//Q3 Learners should be able to figure out the right answers from external to a cluster vs internal to a cluster.

// Q4: Guess the next question fits the OpenStack-Admin-1 better than this course.
// But I want something that ties back to the previous section and the product vs upstream.
// Questions about installation and provisioning are tricky for newbies, but they should be able to answer by referring to the previous section and this is a good reminder that the skills and knowedge of each piece of this course are not self-contained, but related to other pieces.

* [ ] Attaching a VM to a different virtual network.
* [ ] Upgrading RHEL to a newer minor release inside a VM.
* [ ] Configuring IP routing rules for a virtual network.
* [ ] Configuring firewalld rules inside a RHEL VM.

2. Which of the following tasks are more likely to be performed by an OpenStack Operator, as opposed to an OpenStack Administrator?

* [ ] Creating new server instances (VMs).
* [ ] Creating new virtual networks.
* [ ] Creating a new class of virtual server, with provides virtual GPUs.
* [ ] Configuring authentication to an OpenStack cluster using an LDAP server.

* [ ] Configuring VLANs at the switch fabric.
* [ ] Configuring VLANs at the switch fabric to enable compute nodes to connect to those VLANs.
