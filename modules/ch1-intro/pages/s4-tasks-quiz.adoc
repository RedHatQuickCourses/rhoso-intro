*Objective:* 

Relate tasks to OpenStack administrators, operators, and other IT roles.

== Questions

// This quiz could include a matching or drag-and-drop portion but we cannot do that on Antora. :-(

// Crap, Antora breaks questin numbering if there are comments >:-(

// Q1: Even if a learner is not well versed in Linux system administration (which is a prerequisite for this course!) they should be able to get the clues from "inside a VM".

// Q2: Taking care to not include OpenStack jargon that might be unknown from learners, such as "provider networks".
// Learners should be able to figure out the right answers from scope of entire cluster and external to a cluster vs internal to a cluster (virtual servers and networks)

// Q3: I'm having a hard time figuring out appropriate answers to this question.

// Q4: Guess the next question fits the OpenStack-Admin-1 better than this course.
// But I want something that ties back to the previous section and the product vs upstream.
// This may also need knowledge of openstack services, which we didn't introduce yet.
